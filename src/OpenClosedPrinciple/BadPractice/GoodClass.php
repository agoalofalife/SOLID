// The Open Closed Principle
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// This principle says "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification".

// In simple words it can be described as follows â€” all classes, functions etc should be designed so
// in order to change their behavior, we didn't need to change their source code.

// Ok,we remember that we have a class with a single responsibility
// but now there are new conditions
